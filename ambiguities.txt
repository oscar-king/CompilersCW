Paragraph: 21
Problem: The spec uses "=" as an assignment operator.
My solution: I think this is a mistake because in most of the spec and all the sample code ":=" is used for assignment. Therefore "=" is not accepted.

Paragraph: 8
Problem: It is unclear whether all numbers can be defined with underscores e.g. 1_000_000
My solution: Because a lot of programming languages offer implicit conversion and 1_000/1 is equivalent to 1000, I will allow underscores in both integers and floats as well.

Paragraph: 10
Problem: It is unclear whether I should accept strings with unescaped newlines or form feeds.
My solution: To keep things simple and because the spec did not say they should be included, string cannot include a newline or formfeed.

Paragraph: 25
Problem: the p-reverse.s test returns a value: b. The main method should not return a value.
My solution: To adhere to the specification although this is a positive test, my compiler does not accept this syntax.
